**Abstract**: With the emergence of new 360-degree cameras and VR/AR display devices, more diverse multimedia content has become available and with it the demand for the capability of tile-based streaming 360-degree videos to enhance users’ multimedia experience. In this talk, we will discuss the challenges of 360-degree tile-based video streaming due to its large bandwidth and low latency demands and solutions to satisfy the demands, including semantic-aware description of 360-degree videos’ viewing patterns, rate adaptation of tiled videos and view prediction techniques to enable interactive viewing via Head-Mounted Displays. Especially, we will discuss the concept of navigation graphs to **(a).** capture salient objects and events as well as viewing patterns of users, and **(b).** map them into efficient tile-based streaming and viewing experience. We will show how navigation graphs are serving as models to capture diverse semantic content and viewing behaviors in the temporal and spatial domains. Experimental results show that navigation graphs, provided jointly with Media Presentation Descriptors, can assist in efficient solutions of the bandwidth and latency challenges associated with view prediction and user’s interactive viewing. We will also discuss next challenges that future viewing patterns and streaming paradigms will bring as the integration of 360-degree videos, 2D/3D videos, and volumetric media in augmented reality applications is coming.
