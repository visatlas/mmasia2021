The SIGMM EC has decided on a **[*"25 in 25"*](https://records.sigmm.org/2019/10/21/introducing-the-new-role-of-the-director-of-diversity-and-outreach/)** strategy to strategically increase the participation of women in SIGMM and all its activities. This strategy aims at increasing the participation of women in all activities and committees of SIGMM to at least 25% by 2025.

ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 is advocating for a better engagement and involvement of female researchers in all sorts of activities in Multimedia Asia and beyond. The Roundtable (scheduled on Day 2) invites six female panellists at different career stages to share their experiences at being a researcher and educator in multimedia. It will also be an event where participants, both women and men can meet up and exchange ideas.
