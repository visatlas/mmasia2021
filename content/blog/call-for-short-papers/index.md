## Overview

Multimedia research focuses on technologies that enable the use and exchange of content integrating multiple perspectives of digital modalities, including images, text, video, audio (speech, music etc.), and other sensor data. ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 calls for short research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions addressing problems across the domain of multimedia and related applications. The conference also calls for short papers presenting novel ideas and promising (preliminary) results in realizing these ideas.

Short papers provide an opportunity to describe significant novel work in progress or multimedia research. Compared to full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper. Submissions that are likely to generate discussions in new and emerging areas of multimedia are especially encouraged.
