## Overview

ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 invites submission of research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions addressing problems across the domain of multimedia and related applications.

The Applied Research Track of ACM Multimedia Asia 2021 covers all aspects of innovative commercial or industrial-strength multimedia algorithms, systems, solutions, and applications, such as:
- Content-based image/video indexing/retrieval/recommendation
- Cross-domain person re-identification
- Object detection/tracking/recognition/segmentation 
- 3D reconstruction
- Visual localization/navigation
- Social computing

All accepted papers will appear in the proceeding.


## Submission Guidelines
Papers should be submitted through the conference submission system by selecting the **“Applied Research” track**.

Applied research track papers will go through the same double-blind review process as the main track but without a rebuttal phase due to time limitation. Qualified boundary papers rejected by the main track are encouraged to resubmit to the Applied Research Track if the issues raised by the reviewers are sufficiently addressed (please indicate with a cover letter). Submissions must be **6 pages** in length and the paper format is the same as the main track. 

For more details on the format, please see the submission instructions in the main conference [Call for Regular Papers](https://mmasia2021.uqcloud.net/call-for-papers).
