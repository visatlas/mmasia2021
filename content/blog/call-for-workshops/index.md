## Call for Workshop Proposals

We are soliciting proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the ACM Multimedia Asia 2021. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a comprehensive forum on current and emerging topics that could not be fully explored during the main conference and to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues.

## Proposal Format

Each workshop proposal (maximum 4 pages, in PDF format) must include:

1. Title of the workshop.

2. Workshop organizers (name, contact and short biography).

3. Scope and topics of the workshop.

4. Rationale:
   - Why the workshop is related to ACM Multimedia Asia 2021.
   - Why the topic is important.
   - Why the workshop may attract a reasonable number of attendees.
   - A brief biography for each organizer and panelist.

5. Workshop details:
   - A draft call for papers (including organizers, program committee, and steering committee if any). Organizers are expected to be fully committed and physically present at the workshop.
   - Workshop tentative schedule (number of expected papers, duration full-half day, format talks/posters, etc.). We encourage both full-day and half-day events that demonstrate the interest of the community in the proposed topic and guarantee the commitment of the organizers. 
   - Names of potential participants and invited speakers (if any).

6. Workshop history:
   - If there are past workshops, the history of the workshop.
