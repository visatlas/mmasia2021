## Call for Workshop Proposals

We are soliciting proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the ACM Multimedia Asia 2021. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a comprehensive forum on current and emerging topics that could not be fully explored during the main conference and to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues.

## Proposal Format

Each workshop proposal (maximum 4 pages, in PDF format) must include:
